We manually analyzed the experimental data and found that for the cattle1 data set, front face: side face: extreme side face is close to 2.9: 5.45: 1, which shows that in real life, when we collect cattle face images, we tend to collect side faces, which means Under real farm conditions, it is difficult to obtain a perfect frontal face image. At the same time, in order to obtain a suitable recognition data set like normal face images, we conducted a second collection. Most of the cattle2 collected this time were frontal face data. , the front-to-side ratio is close to 3.2:1. A total of 35703 images of data were collected.
